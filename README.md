# INVESTMENT STUDY FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE TWO TRANSFORMATIVE RESULTS IN THE UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND (UNFPA) 2022-2025 STRATEGIC PLAN RELATED TO MATERNAL HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNING FOR THE CASE OF PERU, 2021-2030

Abstract

This article summarizes the Investment study of UNFPA’s Branch in Peru for the achievement of two transformative results from UNFPA’s Global 2022-2025 Strategic Plan to eliminate preventable causes of Maternal Mortality and unmet family planning needs. The study calculated the benefit-cost ratio of accomplishing the goals related to both transformative results for the year 2030 by means of the implementation of a number of interventions prioritized for being critical, effective and high-impact according to evidence. To this end, it was estimated that the necessary investment in prioritized interventions in order to achieve the goals of reducing maternal mortality from a baseline of 85.2 (in 2010) to 41.3 and 33 per 100,000 live births in 2030 sits between 61 and 130 million USD, while the estimated investment to increase the percentage of women who employ modern contraceptive methods from 39.3% (in 2019) to 46.5%, 54.5% and 58.8% is 53, 79 and 109 million USD, respectively. The return of investment is positive for all cases.  In the scenarios of maternal mortality goals, the benefit-cost ratios are 4.8 and 3.3, while in family planning they are 7.5, 5.5 and 4.5. Prioritized interventions were chosen from the selection available in the LiST and FamPlan models employed for the development of the investment study, from public policy analysis and management software Spectrum. The selection was based on the review of evidence, recommendations of specialized organizations, an appraisal of their effectiveness, cost and application in developing countries, and discussion and prioritization on the part of national authorities and other key actors in maternal-neonatal health and reproductive and sexual health in Perú.
